		For our craps game on the html side, we need: 
			1. button to play craps
	   	2. craps status line
			3. header saying craps played here
			
			the story of our craps game......
	Story begins with 2 astronauts. Astronaut 1 being Billy and 	astronaut 2 being Eddie. They couldnt agree on who should be the one to 	travel into space. Both of them wanted to but neither was willing to 	let the other one go. Running out of time, a collegue Steve suggested 	that they settle it with a game of craps. "Best 2 out 3", steve said  	winner gets to go. Long story short Billy won.
										The End!
						*Hope you enjoy my short story :)*
